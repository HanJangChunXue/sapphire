<h1>Working with Java Types</h1>

<p>When implementing Eclipse tooling that works with Java projects, a frequent requirement is to
deliver models and UI that reference Java types (classes, interfaces, enumerations and annotations). 
Implementing this from scratch, even using the excellent API provided by JDT is a challenge. Fortunately,
Sapphire's JDT integration makes this quite easy.</p>

<p>The first step is the model.</p>

<pre class="source-code"><code>@Type( base = JavaTypeName.class )
@Reference( target = JavaType.class )
@Label( standard = "filter" )
@JavaTypeConstraint( kind = { JavaTypeKind.CLASS, JavaTypeKind.INTERFACE }, type = "java.io.FileFilter" )
@MustExist
@Required

ValueProperty PROP_FILTER = new ValueProperty( TYPE, "Filter" );

ReferenceValue&lt;JavaTypeName,JavaType> getFilter();
void setFilter( String value );
void setFilter( JavaTypeName value );</code></pre>

<p>Here we utilize reference value construct which states
that the property holds a JavaTypeName which is resolvable to a JavaType. The resolution is provided
by the framework and works as long as the model is loaded in the context of a Java project.</p>

<p>The @JavaTypeConstraint annotation specifies that the referenced type must be a class or an interface and that
it must derive from java.io.FileFilter type.</p>

<p>The @MustExist annotation specifies that the named type must be present in the project.</p>

<p>The @Required annotation specifies that the property must have a value (null is not ok).</p>

<p>The next step is the UI definition. Here we create an editor section with a single property editor, 
but the property editor is, of course, not limited to editor sections. It can be used in any form context.</p>

<pre class="source-code"><code><font color="#888888">&lt;section>
    &lt;content></font>
        &lt;property-editor>Filter&lt;/property-editor>
    <font color="#888888">&lt;/content>
&lt;/section></font></code></pre>

<p>That is all that is necessary to define a model property that references a Java type and to present that
property in the UI. Once this example is executed, you will see a property editor that is composed of 
a label, a text box, two action buttons and a validation feedback marker.</p>

<p>Clicking on the validation feedback marker shows the problem message along with wealth of semantic
information about the property.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><img src="images/Capture-2.png"/></p>

<p>The browse button provides the means to select from among existing Java types using JDT's type selection
dialog. The framework automatically constraints the contents of the dialog based on @JavaTypeConstraint annotation.<p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><img src="images/Capture-4.png"/></p>

<p>The create button provides the means to define a new Java type if the specified type name cannot be resolved.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><img src="images/Capture-5.png"/></p>

<p>Since @JavaTypeConstraint annotation in this example specifies that the property can reference either a class or an interface,
the user is presented with a choice after clicking on the create button.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><img src="images/Capture-6.png"/></p>

<p>Once the appropriate option is selected, the new type is created and opened in the Java editor. The created
type derives from the type specified in @JavaTypeConstraint annotation and is formatted according to user's
format preferences.</p>
